    "Inference using RDFS and OWL can be a confusing topic as it is not intuitive how topics like Domain and Range work when living with an [Open World Assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption). It is common for folks to interpret, for example, the Domain of an Object or Data Propery in RDFS as a restriction on allowable values, when that is not what actually takes place during inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll use the [OWL-RL](https://github.com/RDFLib/OWL-RL) library to show how inference works when specifying the Domain of an Object property to help others avoid some of the modeling errors I'm made and to better understand how inference can be benneficial.\n",

    "### Interpreting the results\n",
    "- As you'll notice, we now have an additional `rdf:type` associated with our `:non-typed-indv` indicating that it is a `nidm:NIDM_0000054`\n",
    "- This new type indicates that our object is a \"Mask Map\", but is that what we wanted? Possibly, but let's think about this a bit more...\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are modeling a given domain in OWL it is important to know what inferences will come out of your design decisions. Here, the use of `rdfs:domain` on an `owl:DatatypePropery` caused us to infer specific type information simply by using the property.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this case the property is for \"noise FWHM In Verticies\", which is pretty specific with the definition of:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Estimated Full Width at Half Maximum of the spatial smoothness of the noise process in vertices.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Any resource using this property, where the author read the definition, is probably in good shape to infer that this is likely a \"Mask Map\"; however, it is important to ask the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Is there ever a situation where this property could be reasonably applied to an object that is not a Mask Map?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Possibly not, but inferring new types is not what I originally though of intuitively in the context of data modeling. My original expectation, from a modeling perspective using XSD or relational databases, is that `rdfs:domain` would place a restriction that could be used to validate if this object indeed conforms to its type definition. This is clearly not the case with RDFS reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For validation with RDF models there is, surprisingly, no straightforward solution. Although there are a number of efforts in this space with [SPIN Rules](http://spinrdf.org) and [ShEx RDF Shape Expressions](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/ShEx). \n",

    "Another avenue to explore in a future post is the use of [OWL Property Restrictions](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Property_Restrictions)"
