Summary: A little info about me.

Hi there and and welcome to my website, blog, etc. I'm a researcher, informationist, and data architect among many other activties and interests. I finished up my PhD in the Biomedical and Health Informatics program at the University of Washington in Seattle back in December of 2014. My disseration contributed a data exchange standard called [NIDM](http://nidm.nidash.org) that aims to overcome barriers to data sharing and reproducibility in human brain imaging. During my time at UW I became passionate about [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and continue to advocate for conducting science in the open, particularly in the neuroimaging community.

Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow with appointments at the Center for Health Sciences and SRI International and in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. I'm working on a project called [NCANDA](http://www.ncanda.org) that is investigating neurodevelopment in adolescence with imaging and clinical measures.

I live with my wife, Lindsay, in the Bay Area, along with our two [Pixie-bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie-bob) kittens.
