Summary: A little info about me.

Currently, I'm a PhD Candidate in the Biomedical and Health Informatics program at the University of Washington in Seattle where my thesis work addresses barriers data sharing and reproducibility in Human brain imaging. I've become quite enamored with [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) during my tenure here at UW and have greatly enjoyed contributing what I can while completing my dissertation, particularly in the neuroimaging community.

My lovely wife, Lindsay, and I live in a rapidly growing area of Seattle called Ballard with Vela and Argo - our two [Pixie-bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie-bob) kittens.
