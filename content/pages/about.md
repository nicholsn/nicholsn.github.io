Summary: A little info about me.

Hi there and welcome to my website, blog, etc. I'm an informatics scie and
data architect among many other activities and interests. I finished up my PhD in the
Biomedical and Health Informatics program at the University of Washington in Seattle
back in December 2014. My dissertation contributed a data exchange standard
called [NIDM](http://nidm.nidash.org) that aims to overcome barriers to data sharing and
reproducibility in human brain imaging. During my time at UW I became passionate
about [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and continue to advocate
for conducting science in the open, particularly in the neuroimaging community.

Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow with appointments at the Center for Health Sciences
and SRI International and in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University
School of Medicine. I'm working on a project called [NCANDA](http://www.ncanda.org) that
is investigating neurodevelopment in adolescence with imaging and clinical measures.

I live with my wife, Lindsay, in the Bay Area, along with our
two [Pixie-bob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie-bob) kittens.
